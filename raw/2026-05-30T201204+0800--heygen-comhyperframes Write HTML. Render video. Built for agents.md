HyperFrames is an open-source framework for turning HTML, CSS, media, and seekable animations into deterministic MP4 videos. Use it locally with the CLI, from AI coding agents with skills, or as the rendering core behind hosted authoring workflows.

## Quick Start

### With an AI coding agent

Install the HyperFrames skills, then describe the video you want:

```
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes
```

Try a prompt like:

> Using `/hyperframes`, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title, a background video, and subtle background music.

The skills teach agents the HyperFrames production loop: plan the video, write valid HTML, wire seekable animations, add media, lint, preview, and render. They work with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, and other coding agents that support skills.

For visual design handoff workflows, see the [Claude Design guide](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/guides/claude-design) and [Open Design guide](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/guides/open-design).

### Manually with the CLI

```
npx hyperframes init my-video
cd my-video
npx hyperframes preview      # preview in browser with live reload
npx hyperframes render       # render to MP4
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+, FFmpeg

## What You Can Build

Need ideas? Browse the [Showcase](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/showcase) for finished videos you can watch, read, run, and remix.

- Product launch videos and feature announcements
- PR walkthroughs with animated code diffs, narration, and captions
- Data visualizations, chart races, and map animations
- Social videos with kinetic captions, overlays, and music
- Docs-to-video, PDF-to-video, and website-to-video explainers
- Reusable motion graphics for automated content pipelines

## How It Works

Define a video as HTML. Add data attributes for timing and tracks. Use GSAP, CSS, Lottie, Three.js, Anime.js, WAAPI, or your own frame adapter for seekable animation.

```
<div id="stage" data-composition-id="launch" data-start="0" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
  <video
    class="clip"
    data-start="0"
    data-duration="6"
    data-track-index="0"
    src="intro.mp4"
    muted
    playsinline
  ></video>

  <h1 id="title" class="clip" data-start="1" data-duration="4" data-track-index="1">Launch day</h1>

  <audio
    data-start="0"
    data-duration="6"
    data-track-index="2"
    data-volume="0.5"
    src="music.wav"
  ></audio>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
    tl.from("#title", { opacity: 0, y: 40, duration: 0.8 }, 1);
    window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
    window.__timelines.launch = tl;
  </script>
</div>
```

Preview instantly in the browser. Render locally or in Docker. The renderer seeks each frame in headless Chrome and encodes the result with FFmpeg, so the same input produces the same video.

## HyperFrames Stack

HyperFrames is the open-source rendering engine, plus a growing set of tools around HTML-native video creation.

| Piece | Status | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI | Available | Scaffold, preview, lint, inspect, and render local video projects |
| Core / Engine / Producer | Available | Parse compositions, drive headless Chrome, encode video, and mix audio |
| Catalog | Available | Reusable blocks and components for transitions, overlays, captions, charts, maps, and effects |
| Agent skills | Available | Teach coding agents the video-production patterns that generic web docs miss |
| Studio | Available, evolving | Browser surface for previewing and editing compositions |
| AWS Lambda rendering | Available | Deploy a distributed render stack and drive renders from your laptop or CI |
| [hyperframes.dev](https://www.hyperframes.dev/) | Available | Community playground for previewing, iterating, sharing, and rendering HTML-native video projects |
| Design.HTML | In development | Visualize a brand identity and turn it into reusable, video-ready HyperFrames compositions |

## Catalog

Install ready-to-use blocks and components:

```
npx hyperframes add flash-through-white   # shader transition
npx hyperframes add instagram-follow      # social overlay
npx hyperframes add data-chart            # animated chart
```

Browse the catalog at [hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/data-chart).

## Why HyperFrames?

- **HTML-native:** compositions are HTML files with data attributes. No React requirement, no proprietary timeline format.
- **Agent-friendly:** agents already write HTML, and the CLI is non-interactive by default.
- **Deterministic:** same input, same frames, same output. Built for CI, regression tests, and automated rendering.
- **No build step:** an `index.html` composition plays as-is and can be previewed directly in the browser.
- **Adapter-based animation:** bring GSAP, CSS animations, Lottie, Three.js, Anime.js, WAAPI, or a custom runtime.
- **Open source:** Apache 2.0 license, with no per-render fees or commercial-use thresholds.

## HyperFrames vs Remotion

HyperFrames is inspired by [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/). Both tools render video with headless Chrome and FFmpeg. The main difference is the authoring model: Remotion's bet is React components; HyperFrames' bet is plain HTML that humans and agents can both write easily.

|  | **HyperFrames** | **Remotion** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authoring | HTML + CSS + seekable animation | React components |
| Build step | None; `index.html` plays as-is | Bundler required |
| Agent handoff | Plain HTML files | JSX / React project |
| Library-clock animations | Seekable, frame-accurate via adapters | Wall-clock animation patterns need care |
| Distributed rendering | Local and AWS Lambda render paths | Remotion Lambda, mature cloud renderer |
| License | Apache 2.0 | Source-available Remotion License |

## Development Note

The repo uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for golden regression-test baselines under `packages/producer/tests/**/output.mp4` (about 240 MB of `.mp4` files). If you're cloning the full repo for development, install Git LFS first:

```
# macOS
brew install git-lfs

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install git-lfs

# Windows
winget install GitHub.GitLFS

# Then, once per machine
git lfs install
```

If you only need source files, you can skip LFS content:

```
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git
```
